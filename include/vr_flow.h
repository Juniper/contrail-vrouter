/* 
 * Limit the number of outstanding flows in hold state. The flow rate can
 * be much more than what agent can handle. In such cases, to make sure that
 *
 * . pkt0 is not overrun
 * . too many packets are not cached in flow table
 * . too many entries in hold state which will get serviced slowly (of the
 * order of seconds)
 * . and thus starving the table of new entries
 *
 * we limit the number of entries that are in hold state. In a simplistic
 * scenario, all we would need is one variable that is incremented every
 * time a hold entry is added, and decremented when agent changes the
 * state of the entry from hold to any other state (including deletion).
 * However, there will be contention for that variable from all cpus. To
 * avoid the contention, we will make it a per-cpu variable. Once we make
 * a per-cpu variable, there no longer can be a single variable whose
 * value can be decremented. So, to work around that problem, we
 * will have two monotonically incrementing objects, monitoring the hold
 * count and the count of entries that went from hold to active/delete.
 * The single variable that tracks the latter can't be 32 bit, but the
 * former has to be 32 bit since the sum of all of them has to be compared
 * against the latter, and hence can't be each 64bit.
 *
 * How do we solve overflows?
 *
 * We don't care for overflow of the first variable (since it is 64bit).
 * Whenever any of the per-cpu variable (32bit) overflows, our strategy
 * is to decrement the 64 bit variable from the 32 bit, if the former is
 * lesser or to decrement the 64 bit variable by 32bit_max, if the former
 * is greater. Only in those cases, lock is taken. It is guaranteed that
 * no two values will differ by more than hold count.
