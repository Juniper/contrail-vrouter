vrouter_test.sh file contains envrironment set and then executes the test case. After each test case we are rolling back the entire configuration 
to empty except(vrouter) kernel module . And each test case is independent from the rest of the other. Each test case has two python script files,
one script is to write frame on to the TAP interface and second one reads from a different TAP interface 


Steps to run Vrouter testcases: 
1. Load  kernel using fab command
	ex: fab all_reimage@LATEST
2.Run "fab install_contrail" command to for stting up the environment
3.Copy SCAPY rpm to the host if it is not there as part of the package  and then install scapy
4.Copy all the test scripts  including python and bash
